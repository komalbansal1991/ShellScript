Q. One line code to find all files having specific name in a folder (recursively) containing a given string
find . -name file_name | xargs grep -il sftp  #xargs is used to specify multiple arguments to a command, -i for case-insensitive match, -l to print filename only
find . -name file_name -exec grep -il sftp {} \; #exec will take one input at a time from find command and substitute in {}. Also \; is needed to terminate exec command.
